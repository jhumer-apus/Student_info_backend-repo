# The structure of data is:

{

id:int,

student_data:object

}

# To begin

1. Run app.js
2. You can use postman api platform to test or a mock frontend web-application of student form.
3. Paste the adress "http://localhost:3000"

# Recommendation
I'm still creating for the frontend of this server side student information.
